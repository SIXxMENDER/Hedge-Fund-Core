# Hedge Fund Core | Algorithmic Trading Architecture

> **Hybrid Investment System | Fusion of Behavioral Strategy and Algorithmic Execution (AI)**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

In today's fast-paced financial markets, competitive advantage no longer resides solely in human intuition or cold computational logic. **It resides in their fusion**.

This repository represents a **next-generation investment architecture**: a hybrid system that synergistically integrates the deep expertise of a strategist in investments and behavioral psychology with the power of **Psiquis-X**, an advanced Artificial Intelligence engine.

This is not simply a collection of scripts; it is a **superior investment architecture**, designed for institutional operations, family offices, and high-net-worth traders seeking exceptional and sustainable results.

## 🧠 Our Methodology: The 70/30 Paradigm

Our approach breaks with traditional models. We operate under a proprietary **70/30** methodology that optimizes decision-making and execution, generating an asymmetric market advantage.

### **[ 70% ] AI Quantitative Execution and Analysis (Psiquis-X)**

The Psiquis-X engine handles the heavy lifting with superhuman precision and speed:

- **Massive Data Analysis:** Processing terabytes of real-time market data to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies invisible to the human eye.
- **Rigorous Backtesting:** Simulation of thousands of scenarios to validate and optimize strategies under any market condition.
- **Algorithmic Execution:** Operations executed in milliseconds, without emotional biases like fear or greed.
- **Automated Risk Management:** 24/7 monitoring and instant application of predefined risk protocols.

### **[ 30% ] Expert Human Strategy and Supervision**

The human layer provides context, wisdom, and strategic direction that no AI can replicate alone:

- **Investment Thesis Definition:** We establish the fundamental "why" behind each strategy, based on macroeconomic principles and behavioral psychology.
- **Qualitative Interpretation:** Analysis of "black swan" events, regulatory paradigm shifts, and market sentiment nuances that pure data doesn't capture.
- **Ethical and Strategic Supervision:** Ensuring the AI operates within defined parameters, adjusting the overall strategy and making critical decisions in moments of high uncertainty.

**The result is a virtuous cycle:** Human strategy guides AI, AI validates and executes the strategy with unmatched efficiency, and the resulting data refines the next human strategic decision.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three levels of complexity, each representing a key component of our trading architecture:

### **01_Catalyst_Data_Engine** 📊 (Silver Tier)

**Critical Task Accelerator**

Market data ingestion and processing module. This is the fundamental engine that connects with exchanges (Binance, Poloniex) and downloads real-time OHLCV data, calculating key technical indicators (RSI, MACD) for quantitative analysis.

- **Main file:** `data_loader.py`
- **Use cases:** Automation of historical data download, technical indicator calculation, monitoring of multiple trading pairs.
- **Technologies:** Python, ccxt, pandas, pandas-ta

> **Value proposition:** Eliminates costly operational bottlenecks. A surgical tool that automates critical tasks, freeing the team to focus on strategy and reducing human error risk to zero.

### **02_Sentinel_Execution_Bot** 🎯 (Gold Tier)

**Algorithmic Execution Agent**

Autonomous trading bot implementing moving average crossover strategies with integrated risk management. Operates 24/7 executing simulated orders with automatic stop-loss and detailed operation logging.

- **Main file:** `sniper_bot.py`
- **Use cases:** Automated execution of trend strategies, real-time risk management, unattended operations.
- **Technologies:** Python, requests, pandas, numpy

> **Value proposition:** Converts your investment strategy into an autonomous, disciplined, tireless agent. Executes market theses with millisecond precision, 24/7, without fear or greed.

### **03_Nexus_Architecture** 🏗️ (Platinum Tier)

**AI Quantitative Engine Design and Implementation**

Complete technical architecture for an Autonomous Hedge Fund. Includes the macro system vision: from multi-source data ingestion, AI processing (LSTM, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning), to order execution and human supervision.

- **Main file:** `architecture.md`
- **Components:** Data platform (Kafka, Data Lake), AI core (SageMaker, MLflow), Execution and operations, Human supervision
- **Technologies:** AWS, Kubernetes, Apache Spark, TimescaleDB, Python/Go/Rust

> **Value proposition:** The keys to a next-generation investment engine. A complete architecture that integrates human strategy with algorithmic execution, positioning at the market forefront with proprietary infrastructure to generate alpha sustainably.
